# TETRIS
## Project description
It is my first bigger Java project. My solution is based on YouTuber Ryisnow's code (link to the tutorial in Credits). I have already added a new functionality and I am planning to develop this program.
I am doing it to fully understand the concept of object-oriented programming and combine it with my additional activities during studying applied computer science- neuroinformatics. 
## How to run the code
You need to install development environment that supports Java. Then clone this repository and run the code.
## How to play
Use arrows to navigate tetrominos. Press: <br>⬆️ - rotate the tetromino <br> ⬇️ - drop the tetromino <br> ➡️ - move the tetromino to the right <br> ⬅️ - move the tetromino to the left <br> SPACE - to pause the game
